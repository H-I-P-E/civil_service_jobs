Consumes a set of emails from civilservicejobs.com and creates a csv.

Also downloads all the adverts as html - to get this to run correctly you will need a username and password for civilservicejobs.com. These will need to be stored in this folder in a file called 'user_name_and_password.R' with the following contents:

username = "your_csj_username_here"
password = "your_csj_password_here"
